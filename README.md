Tourism Website UX Design Project
Welcome to the Tourism Website UX Design Project! This project involved designing and developing a responsive, user-friendly website to promote a tropical island destination. The goal was to create an engaging and intuitive platform for visitors to explore attractions, accommodations, and booking options. The project followed a structured UX design process, including research, wireframing, prototyping, usability testing, and iterative improvements based on user feedback.

Project Overview

This project focused on delivering a seamless user experience for a tourism website. Key features include:

Homepage: A visually appealing introduction to the destination with a hero image and call-to-action buttons.
Attractions: Detailed information about popular tourist spots, including beaches, rainforests, and volcanoes.
Accommodations: A comparison of lodging options, such as hotels, Bed & Breakfasts, and private condos.
Booking: A user-friendly form for visitors to book their stay.
Contact Us: A feedback form for visitors to reach out with inquiries or messages.
The website was designed with a tropical, beachy vibe, using custom fonts (Pacifico for headings and Quicksand for body text) and a natural color palette to evoke a sense of relaxation and adventure.

UX Design Process

The project followed a structured UX design process, which included the following stages:

1. Research and Planning

Conducted a competitive analysis of existing tourism websites to identify best practices and areas for improvement.
Defined user personas to represent the target audience, including families, solo travelers, and adventure seekers.
Created a sitemap and user flow to outline the websiteâ€™s structure and navigation.

2. Wireframing and Prototyping

Developed low-fidelity wireframes to visualize the layout and structure of each page.
Gathered internal feedback on the wireframes and made necessary adjustments.
Created high-fidelity designs and an interactive prototype for usability testing.

3. Usability Testing

Conducted guerrilla usability testing with three users to identify pain points and areas for improvement.
Tasks included:
Finding information about attractions.
Booking accommodations.
Sending a message through the contact form.
Comparing prices of different lodging options.
Testing the websiteâ€™s responsiveness on mobile devices.

4. Feedback and Iteration

Based on the usability testing, the following feedback was implemented:
Confirmation Messages: Added confirmation messages after form submissions (e.g., booking and contact forms) to reassure users that their actions were successful.
Navigation Improvements: Added a "Back to Home" button on all pages and created a dedicated price comparison page for easier access to accommodation details.
Visual Enhancements: Improved the color contrast of the "Welcome" message on the homepage for better readability.
Key Features

Responsive Design:
The website is fully responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Interactive Prototype:

User-Centered Design:
The design process was guided by user feedback, ensuring the final product met the needs and expectations of the target audience.
Tropical Theme:
